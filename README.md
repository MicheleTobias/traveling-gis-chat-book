Learn to make your own web map with Leaflet with DataLab's [Building Web Maps with Leaflet Workshop](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_web_maps/).

# Updating the Web Map

As the book travels to new locations, this web map can be updated by adding new locations to the dataset.

Edit the `locations.csv` file, adding the city, state, and country information. Leave the lat and long columns blank. The GitHub action on this repository will automatically geocode any blank lat/long columns.
